Description of the algorithm implemented by the modelRun class (work in progress)

   # make a copy of the origin total pop array for this ageband

   # loop through each destination collection

   #     grab the time profile for this collection

   #     find the on site / in travel % for the specified time (from timeseries)

   #     loop through each destination row in the collection

   #         grab the population for the specified ageband
   #            (calculated on load, using the total pop and ageband percentages)

   #             calculate for destination required OnSite Pop / InTravel Pop

   #             loop through each WAD pair (note nearest always first)
   #                 add empty origin pop count and origin list to each WAD list

   #             loop through each origin
   #                 calculate distance to current destination
   #                   work through WADs stepping through smallest to largest radius
   #                   add index to origin list for smallest matching WAD 
   #                   update pop total for corresponding matching WAD

   #             loop through each WAD pair again, smallest to largest radius
   #                 for each one with total origin pop > 0
   #                    for each origin in the list
   #                       calc ratio of origin pop to total orig pop
   #                       remove from origins
   #                       remove from WAD pop total
   #                         pass pop total to next WAD (or pull from next)
   #                         pass origins to next WAD (or pull from next)
   #                       (later) remove from inTravel/onSite grids
